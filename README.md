# chrome_tab_garbage_collector
A chrome extension, for unused tab management

Personally I use chrome like an animal, and only open tabs, never close them.
And I also like to open a new tab for every of my browsing.

And well, we all know that this not only make chrome tabs unusable ( since cant browse them effectively )
but makes my RAM chips cry.

The main idea here, is the following: 
This tool will perform an LRU based garbage collect on my tabs, based on rules.
I have webpages, that I can open anytime in the future, and have websites which contains an
article etc, I want to read later.
My rules will define the sites I don't need, those being closed, all the others being moved to a
bookmark folder. This way I still can read it later, but my tabs not overflowing.

TL;DR: This project aim a very specific personal problem, but open sourced ( under MIT license ) for
everyone, who suffer from similar issues than me.
